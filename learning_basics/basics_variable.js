/*
DIFF BETWEEN VAR AND LET
var: Variables declared with var have function scope,
     meaning they are accessible within the entire function, 
     regardless of block-level scope (e.g., if/else, loop, or switch statements).
let: Variables declared with let have block scope,
     which means they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., if/else, loop, or switch statements). 
     If you try to access a let variable outside its block scope, youâ€™ll get a ReferenceError.
